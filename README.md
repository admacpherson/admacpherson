## Recommendations

> As his professor, I have found Andrew to be a thoughtful, conscientious and skillful practitioner. Andrew approaches both his assignments and life-decisions by asking the right questions of the right sources, and developing a well-conceived approach. He is courteous, but has a strong internal ethical compass and stands by his convictions. He is both curious and out-going, taking appropriate risks to gain broad experiences in his educational mission. As a potential employer, I would feel fortunate to have Andrew among the candidates.

> Andrew is thoughtful and conscientious. He works diligently at all he does, and attempts to see all sides of a problem in order to bring about good solutions. I have known him to be very persistent and mature for his age. He is particularly skilled at statistics and data analysis. He engaged in a special honors project for us at Pacifica where he created a survey to analyze the correlation between moral/ethical theories and political affiliation. This set him apart from many of his peers. I highly recommend him to you.

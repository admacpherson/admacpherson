## Recommendations
> As his professor, I have found Andrew to be a thoughtful, conscientious and skillful practitioner. Andrew approaches both his assignments and life-decisions by asking the right questions of the right sources, and developing a well-conceived approach. He is courteous, but has a strong internal ethical compass and stands by his convictions. He is both curious and out-going, taking appropriate risks to gain broad experiences in his educational mission. As a potential employer, I would feel fortunate to have Andrew among the candidates.

> Andrew is thoughtful and conscientious. He works diligently at all he does, and attempts to see all sides of a problem in order to bring about good solutions. I have known him to be very persistent and mature for his age. He is particularly skilled at statistics and data analysis. He engaged in a special honors project for us at Pacifica where he created a survey to analyze the correlation between moral/ethical theories and political affiliation. This set him apart from many of his peers. I highly recommend him to you.

Rev. Christopher Stratton | Academic Dean | Pacifica Christian Orange County

> Andrew was a fellow under my management for the Harley Rouda for Congress campaign. Early on, he took an active role within the fellowship program and eventually became one of the leaders amongst his peers, providing essential help on the data side of the program. He is active, persistent, and consistent, and receives my full endorsement for future employment opportunities.
